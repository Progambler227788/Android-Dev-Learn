LiveData is a datastrcuture, View Model handles views,
It will store data in a model class so if orientation
changes, no loading needed. Repository is a class, it manages
data sources. Internal data source is local database, files
and remote data source as well like from apis using retrofit library.
ViewModel takes data from repository so viewmodel will handle
different tasks easily. Model does not know usage of data in Repository.
There's separation of concerns here.
